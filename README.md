# 🚀 Course Q&A Platform 🚀

This platform is designed to facilitate Q&A interactions related to various courses. It's a one-stop solution for students and educators to engage in productive discussions and knowledge sharing.

## 📚 Features 📚

- Large language model endpoint
- API endpoint starter for the QA platform
- UI starter for the QA platform

## 🛠️ Setup 🛠️

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` in the `qa-ui` directory to install dependencies.
3. Start the application using Docker Compose with the command `docker-compose up`.

Please note that starting the application for the first time may take a while, as it also downloads the (small) large language model (approx. 250 megabytes) and packages it into an image.

## 📝 Future Improvements 📝
